# üçè Fake fruit and vegetable online store üçè

## Made using create-react-app together with TypeScript. Styled using Sass.

This is one of my first React projects. I also practised my TypeScript and Sass in this project. 

- You can add fake vegetables and fruits to a fake shopping cart and they are also getting stored in the localStorage. 
- Inside the shopping cart the total price of the cart is shown, as well as each individual product. 
- It is possible to change the amount of each product in the cart or remove it completely.
